Programming Experience:
 I have some experience but it's nothing major, I still have trouble remembering how to code.

9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.

  It was fine for the first 2/3 of the year since I could get help when I needed it, but then the pandemic hit and it was pretty rough after that. School didn't go into virtual till a month after, I forgot a lot about coding during that so the transition was difficult. 



10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).




What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?
